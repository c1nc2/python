def dot_product(u, v):

        raise ValueError("The two input lists must have the same length.")
    return sum([u[i] * v[i] for i in range(len(u))])


# This function first checks whether the two input lists have the same length. If they do not, it raises a ValueError with an error message indicating that the lists must have the same length.
# If the two input lists have the same length, the function then calculates the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of each list using a list comprehension and the built-in sum function, and returns the result.
# As you mentioned, dot product is an important concept in linear algebra and has a wide range of applications, including in CDMA technology which is used in 3G and other communication systems. In CDMA, each user is assigned a unique code that is used to encode their signal, and the coded signals from multiple users are transmitted simultaneously over the same frequency band. The receiver then uses the appropriate code to decode the desired signal. The dot product is used in this process for correlating the received signal with the appropriate code.
